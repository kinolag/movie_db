# Movie DB app

This application lets you see the trending shows on The Movie DB (TMDB).

A search feature is also implemented.  

In both cases, results are filtered by type: Movie or TV Show.

You can also see more details for each show.

Four routes are implemented: home, search, movie and tv show.

## Keyboard Navigation

On devices that have a keyboard, the results grid can be navigated with the four 'Arrow' keys. The 'Enter' key navigates to the selected item page.

## Responsive Design

The app adapts to mobile / smaller screen devices as the grid layout is responsive.

## Technology

The app was developed with the Remix framework and TypeScript.

## Deployment

The app is live on Vercel at the address on the right.

### Notes / Improvements

Some simple tests are included (using Vitest and React Testing Library).

Initial support for pagination is also there.
